					<p>
						Remi Anthony Russell is a first year student in the Multimedia Productions program at Lethbridge
						College. He spends large portions of his spare time progressing in various video games or
						hanging out with virtual friends. He aspires to find a career in game design, and often takes
						note of his favourite elements of games to consider for future projects. He also enjoys watching
						game and story design videos on YouTube.
					</p>
					<p>
						During his grade 12 year, he managed to achieve both the honour roll and an award for excellence
						in his digital media class, often assisting fellow students or even the teacher due to his habit of
						learning about the software. He was also a member of the 1st Drumheller troop of Scouts Canada
						for three years, becoming the troop leader for most of that time. He led multiple activities
						from highway clean ups to camping trips, a short trip to visit a fellow scout troop in the
						northwest territories, and even an adventure to the 2019 Pacific Jamboree
						in Vancouver. He’s also volunteered with senior centres, usually playing games with them to help pass the time.

					<p>He’s often noted by friends and coworkers to be incredibly friendly and outgoing, and is very
						often actively looking for ways to help others if his own tasks are completed during work or
						school hours. Despite occasional distractions, he works hard once he gets focused on a task, and
						has proven to be both incredibly academically capable and willing to attempt nearly any task. He
						has a couple personal mottos, but his main one is “Take a chance to make it all the way” (or
						simply just 'Take a chance'), based
						on the theme song of his favourite TV show growing up.
