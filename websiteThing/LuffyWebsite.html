	<section id="Personality">
		<h2>Personality</h2>

		<p>Luffy is a very simple person on the surface. He loves food, his friends, and having adventures. He tends to
			be very silly, only ever taking situations seriously when the well being of those he cares for is
			threatened. He is especially notable in the fact that he has no mental filter, and will say every thought as
			they enter his head. This can often get him in trouble, and also means that when he is quiet his head is
			literally empty. He's not traditionally very smart, lacking in some common sense and often making silly
			decisions. To contrast this however, he is incredibly emotionally intelligent. He can almost always tell
			when someone is lying to themself about how they feel, and instinctively knows whether or not someone is
			good natured, even if they act in an opposite manner.</p>

	<section id="goals" class="alternate">
		<h2>Goals</h2>

		<p>As the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy's main goal is to find the legendary treasure known as the one
			piece and become king of the pirates. He wants this because his true dream is to be the most free man in the
			world, and the pirate king answers to nobody. Another of his goals is to make all his friends as free as he
			wants to be, with plenty of tasty food and parties. He accomplishes this by punching anyone and everyone who
			is mean to his friends, no questions asked.</p>

	<section id="skills">
		<h2>Skills</h2>

		<p>Luffy is the captain of his crew, and mostly serves as the strongest combatant and leader. He ate a magical
			devil fruit known as the Gum Gum fruit. This made it so he looses the ability to move underwater, dooming
			him to drown should he fall off his ship, but in return turned his body into rubber. with near infinite
			stretchability, Luffy's creative mind has created a large variety of special techniques, from stretching his
			arms and legs for ranged punches and kicks to blowing himself up like a balloon, or even using the elastic
			properties of his body to launch himself through the air. He is also incredibly strong, able to pick up and
			throw large blocks of stone. Luffy's greatest strength is actually his charisma however. Luffy's kindness
			knows almost no bounds, and on multiple occasions has overthrown entire governments simply because an
			oppressed citizen fed him a warm meal. People are naturally drawn to Luffy's charm and good-hearted nature,
			leading him to become an almost impossible force.</p>
